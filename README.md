# vipsitemods
A marketing plugin for WordPress to help with sitewide content changes quickly.

This plugin creates a custom post type, VIP Content, that can be used to insert custom code into the content on any theme.

This software was originally designed to address inserting CTAs into Elementor Single Post Templates without interrupting any other plugins that inject content.

VIP Content can be edited like any other post, using a page template with no header and footer (like a landing page template).

The VIP Content will be injected after the defined number of paragraphs into the blog content. It will be dynamically shown only on posts that are in the selected category.
